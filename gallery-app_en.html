The ice mass has a past or present flow, which is caused by internal deformation or sliding at the base. Glaciers accumulate snow in high altitudes and loose mass by ablation at low altitudes and/or discharge into the sea or lakes.\nFurthermore, glaciers are separated into unconstrained and constrained glaciers. Unconstrained glaciers include ice sheets, ice caps and ice streams. Constrained glaciers include ice fields, valley glaciers, transection glaciers (interconnected valley glaciers), piedmont glaciers, cirque and niche glaciers.&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;br&amp;gt;&amp;lt;i&amp;gt;see IPCC, 2013: Climate Change 2013: The Physical Science Basis.

This definition excludes Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets, which are much larger. Ice caps can be found in polar or subtemperate regions, where accumulation of snow commonly exceeds ablation. The formation process is described in the following: glaciers grow in the higher parts of the mountains, nearby glaciers merge and build ice bands around the mountains. These ice bands fuse with the ones from other mountains. As a result they build the ice caps that cover large parts of the land. Ice caps submerge the topography beneath while only some peaks stick out of the ice, which are called \u201cnunataks\u201d.","A glacier calves when a huge mass of ice breaks off at the front of the glacier.

This type of glacier can be found in all major mountain regions of the world, e.g. in the Himalayan it is the predominant form of glaciation. The layer of debris forms by rockfall from nearby mountain faces with high denudation rates, rock avalanching and mixed snow/ice/rock avalanching. The resulting distribution and type of the debris layer influences the glacier\u2019s dynamics, rheology and mass balance, and especially its ablation. Depending on the thickness of the layer, melting increases or decreases: Dispersed debris cover and layers thinner than ~15-80 mm enhance melting, because the rocks heat up under solar radiation. At the contrary thicker layers have an insulating effect and protect the ice from insolation.","Most glaciers are pure ice glaciers.

At the contrary thicker layers have an insulating effect and protect the ice from insolation.","Most glaciers are pure ice glaciers. That means that they are not covered by debris nor riddled with rocks. They form all different shapes that are described in the glacier definition. You can find this kind of glacier on all continents.&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;Please note that we put all glaciers in this category that do not fit to the other glacier types listed, but exhibit the pure ice glacier characteristic."],"glpic_lic":["","(CC BY-SA 3.0 IGO)","","","","(CC BY-NC)","","(CC BY-SA 3.0)","","","","(CC BY 3.0)","","(released into public domain by holder of the work)",""],"img":["https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/lemoncreek.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/7/7b/Columbia_Glacier_%28Alaska%29_by_Sentinel-2.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/white.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/mittivakkat.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/nordenskioldbreen.JPG","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/briksdalsbreen.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/hintereisferner.bmp","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/a/a1/Grosser_Aletschgletscher_3196.JPG","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/tbilisa.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/khumbu.JPG","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/lewis.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/0/06/Artesonraju_Peru.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/peritomoreno.jpg","https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/8/87/Lower_Tasman_Glacier_towards_Minarets.jpg","https://raw.githubusercontent.com/OGGM/glacier-gallery/master/glacier_photos/bahiadeldiablo.bmp"],"name":["Lemon Creek Glacier","Columbia Glacier","White Glacier","Mittivakkat Glacier","Nordenskioldbreen","Briksdalsbreen","Hintereisferner","Gro\u00dfer Aletschgletscher","Tbilisa Glacier","Khumbu Glacier","Lewis","Artesonraju","Perito Moreno","Tasman Glacier","Bahia Del Diablo Glacier"],"no_glacier_selected":["No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!","No glacier selected!"],"pic_cite":["L.
